  <h3>Washington DC Temple</h3>
  <p>Standing on sprawling grounds about 10 miles north of the United States Capitol, 
    the gold-spired Washington D.C. Temple is a well-known landmark along the Capital Beltway in Kensington, Maryland.
     The beauty of this soaring edifice is enhanced by a reflection pond near the visitors' center and a spouting water feature at the temple entrance. </p>
  <h3>Raleigh NC Temple</h3>
  <p>The Raleigh North Carolina Temple was the first temple built in North Carolina.

  </p>
  <h3>Orlando FL Temple</h3>
  <p>The Orlando Florida Temple was the first temple built in Florida.
    The Orlando Florida Temple sits on a knoll overlooking a chain of lakes on the edge of the Orlando suburb of Windermere in an area described as one of Florida's most beautiful locations. 
    The temple is characterized by its white exterior, graceful columns, arched windows, and delightful water features. 
    Palms trees and shrubs are planted generously across the temple grounds that are open to the public.
  </p>
  <h3>Rexburg ID Temple</h3>
  <p>
    Adjacent to the Brigham Young University–Idaho campus, the five-story Rexburg Idaho Temple soars high above its hillside location—creating a striking landmark visible for miles along the Highway 20 corridor.
     It is the finest, most notable building in this rural community. West of the temple lies a beautiful garden area open to the public for quiet strolls or moments of reflection.
